\chapter*{Abstract}

Image processing applications are very popular nowadays. It can be seen in daily life, such as post-processing to improve quality of captured photos from digital cameras. Noise is an important aspect leading to degradation of image quality. This internship focuses on studying different methods to reduce noise in digital photos. In the context of SWARMS project at ICTLab - USTH, noise in captured photos potentially reduces computer vision tasks, such as object or scene recognition. The studied  methods are evaluated using SWARMS image dataset to find out the best method to denoise images for this specific dataset.
