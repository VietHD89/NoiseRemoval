\chapter*{Acknowledgements}

Firstly, I am grateful to my supervisor Dr. Tran Giang Son of the ICTLab at University of Science and Technology of Hanoi (USTH). His regular supports, advices and encouragements have been a key driver for my work.


Next, I would like to thank Prof. Daniel Chillet who is my Tutor at Universit√© de Rennes 1. I also want to thank all members of the ICTLab who were always open to welcome me. This was very helpful in creating good conditions for me to complete this work.


Finally, I would like to thank my family for their loves and supports to me. My parents and younger sister help me very much. From this, I can devote all of my time for the  internship.
