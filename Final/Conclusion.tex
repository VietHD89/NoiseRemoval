This internship focuses on studying denoising methods for digital photos. These methods include Median filter, Average filter, Gaussian filter and Weiner filter. These methods are used in the context of SWARMS project with its captured photos in 4 categories: construction site, rubbish, pagoda and pond. The evaluation shows that all of these 4 methods are effective in denoising artifically-noised images. Additionally, Weiner filter achieves best noise reduction among these methods.

This work can be continued in several directions. First, other methods in frequency domain could be experimented, such as Steinâ€™s Unbiased Risk Estimator SureShrink~\cite{donoho1995noising}, BlockShrink~\cite{4566501} or NeighShrink~\cite{DENGWEN20081694}. Hybrid denoising methods in both spatial and frequency domains~\cite{yue2014cid} are also promising. Second, other image classes could be evaluated to see what kind of image could be best denoised. Last but not least, the experimented should also be quantitative and qualitative compared, not only based on two metrics (MSE and PSNR).
